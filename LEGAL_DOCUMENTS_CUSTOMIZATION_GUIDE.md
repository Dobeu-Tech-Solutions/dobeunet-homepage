# Legal Documents Customization Guide

This guide outlines the placeholders and sections in your Privacy Policy and Terms of Service that require customization before production deployment.

## Overview

Two comprehensive legal documents have been created:
- **Privacy Policy**: `/privacy` route
- **Terms of Service**: `/tos` route

Both documents are production-ready but contain placeholders marked with `[BRACKETS]` that need your specific business information.

## Location Information Discrepancy

**Note**: The documents currently list **Neptune, NJ** as your location, based on the Footer component. However, previous discussions mentioned **Toms River, NJ 08753**. Please verify and update consistently across:
- Privacy Policy (Section 13)
- Terms of Service (Section 16)
- Footer component (`/src/components/Footer.tsx`)
- Any other locations where address appears

---

## Email Addresses to Set Up

The legal documents reference several email addresses. Ensure these are created and monitored:

1. **privacy@dobeu.net** - Privacy inquiries and GDPR/CCPA requests
2. **legal@dobeu.net** - Legal inquiries and dispute resolution
3. **billing@dobeu.net** - Billing and payment questions
4. **support@dobeu.net** - General customer support
5. **info@dobeu.net** - Already exists (used in Footer)

Alternatively, you can:
- Route all to `info@dobeu.net` initially
- Update email addresses in documents to match your structure
